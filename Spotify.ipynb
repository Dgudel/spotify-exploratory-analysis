    "The basic exploratory data analysis of the Top 50 Spotify tracks revealed various characteristics of the most popular Spotify tracks - that the most popular artists are Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa, and Travis Scott; the most popular genre is pop; that energy is correlated with loudness; that alternative/ indie music is the most accoustic while hip-top/ rap is the most loudly and danceable (together with dance/ electronic); etc. The analysis could be improved by applying tests of statistical significance - calculating p-values of correlation coeficients and conducting non-parametric Kruscall Wallis tests for comparison of differences between groups of observations. But for such an analysis the Python library Scipy should be used. Also, data visualisations with Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries could be preformed."
